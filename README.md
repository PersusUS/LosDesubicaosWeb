# 🌌 The Event Horizon

**The Event Horizon** is an educational video game project aimed at introducing players of all ages to the fascinating world of exoplanet detection. Developed in Unity, the game simplifies the complex methodologies of space exploration, making them accessible, engaging, and educational.

## 🚀 High-Level Summary

The goal of *The Event Horizon* is to share knowledge about exoplanets with a student audience through an interactive video game. The game features a compelling narrative, integrated with actual astronomical observation techniques that real-life astrophysicists use, but presented in a simplified and educational format. This blend of storytelling and science aims to bridge the gap between complex scientific concepts and the curiosity of young minds, demystifying exoplanetary science.

## 🎓 Educational Component

### 🪐 Planet Discovery System

The planet discovery mechanics in the game are inspired by real-world techniques used by space agencies like NASA. These complex methodologies have been simplified to ensure that players of all skill levels can understand and engage with the content. This system provides an accessible way for players to experience what it's like to be an astrophysicist.

### 🔭 Realistic Astronomical Observation

In *The Event Horizon*, players use an in-game telescope to view a simulated celestial sphere, which includes moving celestial bodies. Players can zoom in to interact with these objects through mechanics like:

- Observing a planet transit in front of its star
- Measuring brightness changes
- Capturing images in different wavelengths of light

This realistic simulation gives players a deeper understanding of the observational techniques used in astrophysics.

## 🎮 Narrative and Gameplay

### 📖 Story and Educational Goals

In *The Event Horizon*, players assume the role of an aging researcher who resides in a lighthouse on an asteroid, exploring space. The character is searching for their missing daughter, but suffers from amnesia caused by an unknown trauma, complicating the quest.

As the game progresses, players must explore the lighthouse's library and find files on nearby exoplanets to remember the daughter's name. They rediscover these planets using real detection techniques inspired by those used by NASA. By uncovering celestial objects, players also uncover memories of the daughter, her groundbreaking research on black holes, and her ultimate fate.

### ⚙️ Gameplay Mechanics

- **Exploration and Puzzle-Solving**: Players navigate through the game world, solving puzzles related to real exoplanet detection methods.
- **Story Progression**: As players find more exoplanets, the story reveals deeper mysteries about the protagonist’s daughter and their shared connection to space exploration.

## 🤖 Use of AI

The development team consists of seven members, including **Perseo AI**, an artificial intelligence developed by Jesús Pérez Bazarot. Perseo is an advanced AI comparable to models like ChatGPT-4 and has acted as an additional team member, contributing in several ways:

- **Multilingual Content**: Perseo refined multilingual English texts to maintain high-quality standards.
- **Web Development**: Perseo’s programming module accelerated the development of the project’s website.
- **Visual Content**: Through a ComfyUI module, Perseo generated visual assets like images and logos, greatly enhancing the project’s visual presentation.

Perseo’s involvement significantly boosted the team's efficiency and helped manage the complexity of the project.
